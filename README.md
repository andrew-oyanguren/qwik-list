### General Info

This is a simple shopping list app. This project is not responsive, as that was not my goal in building this list. I starting working on this project to practice my JavaScript and further my understanding of manipulating the DOM. I took away a lot of knowledge from completing project. Something I like that I did in this project was that I added the text "need it" and "got it" to each item in place of a common checkbox. 

### Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
